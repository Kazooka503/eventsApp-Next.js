## Mean Feature: Server Side Rendering

*What is the difference between rendering the page 
in client or server?*

(CSR) Client Side Rendering: Client downloads code from web server - 
then JavaScript is executed by client's web browser
and all HTML content will be rendered.

(SSR) Server Side Rendering: Preparing the content of the page on the 
web server so when a client visits a page it is already available for
the client. Allows for fetching of data and prerendering of components on 
the web server.

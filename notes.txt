Intro:
"The React Framework for Production"
"Next.js gives you the best developer experience
with all the features you need for production: hybrid static and 
server side rendering. TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
No config needed."

React is a JavaScript library that helps developers
build complex user interfaces easier than it would be 
with vanilla JS. Next.js is a Framework built on top of 
React. 

Next.js has an easily accesible Web SDK.

Mean Feature: Server Side Rendering

- What is the difference between rendering the page 
in client or server?

(CSR) Client Side Rendering: Client downloads code from web server - 
then JavaScript is executed by client's web browser
and all HTML content will be rendered.

(SSR) Server Side Rendering: Preparing the content of the page on the 
web server so when a client visits a page it is already available for
the client. Allows for fetching of data and prerendering of components on 
the web server. 

SSR vs CSR
(When to use SSR over CSR)
Depends on user experience we want to create and project
requirements. SSR can improve the performance and over all 
experience depending on the app. It's great for 
SEO(search engine optimization) as well. 

In Summary - Next JS is a react framework ready for production.

Improvements Needed for current Build:

Data Base - Currently is in read only, will not allow us to send email registrations through to events
RWD: Responsive Web Design, rendering issues for footer, have content and pages scale according to screen size
Title / page - Image/ page
More feature in event page
Add HEAD to each page
    - Adds specific metadata/page
